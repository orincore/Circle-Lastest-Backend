#### **New Notification Types**

Added to `NotificationService`:

   - Title: "üéâ New Referral!"
   - Message: "{Name} just signed up using your referral code! Referral #{number}"

2. **`referral_approved`** - When admin approves a referral
   - Title: "‚úÖ Referral Approved!"
   - Message: "Your referral #{number} has been approved! ‚Çπ{amount} added to your pending earnings."

3. **`referral_rejected`** - When admin rejects a referral
   - Title: "‚ùå Referral Rejected"
   - Message: "Your referral #{number} was rejected. Reason: {reason}"

4. **`referral_paid`** - When payment is completed
   - Title: "üí∞ Payment Completed!"
   - Message: "Payment of ‚Çπ{amount} for referral #{number} has been completed! Reference: {ref}"

#### **Notification Methods**

```typescript
// Notify when someone signs up with referral code
await NotificationService.notifyReferralSignup(
  referrerId: string,
  referredUserName: string,
  referralNumber: string
);

// Notify when referral is approved
await NotificationService.notifyReferralApproved(
  userId: string,
  referralNumber: string,
  amount: number
);

// Notify when referral is rejected
await NotificationService.notifyReferralRejected(
  userId: string,
  referralNumber: string,
  reason: string
);

// Notify when payment is completed
await NotificationService.notifyReferralPaid(
  userId: string,
  referralNumber: string,
  amount: number,
  paymentReference?: string
);
```

### 3. Live Notifications

All referral notifications are sent in real-time via WebSocket using the existing `emitToUser` function:
- Users receive instant notifications when events occur
- Notifications appear in the notification panel
- Unread count is updated automatically

### 4. Updated Referral Routes

Updated existing routes in `/api/referrals`:

- **`applyReferralCode()`** - Now sends notification to referrer when someone signs up
- **`POST /admin/verify/:transactionId`** - Now sends approval/rejection notification
- **`POST /admin/mark-paid/:transactionId`** - Now sends payment confirmation notification

## Database Schema

The system uses these tables (already created):

1. **`user_referrals`** - User referral codes and earnings
2. **`referral_transactions`** - Individual referral transactions with status tracking
3. **`referral_payment_requests`** - UPI payment requests from users
4. **`referral_code_attempts`** - Analytics for code usage attempts
5. **`notifications`** - Stores all notifications including referral notifications

## Workflow

### Referral Lifecycle

1. **User Signs Up with Referral Code**
   - System validates code
   - Creates pending transaction
   - Sends notification to referrer: "üéâ New Referral!"

2. **Admin Reviews Pending Referrals**
   - Access via `/api/admin/referrals/pending`
   - View all pending referrals with user details
   - Verify authenticity

3. **Admin Approves/Rejects**
   - POST to `/api/admin/referrals/:id/verify`
   - System updates transaction status
   - Sends notification to user:
     - If approved: "‚úÖ Referral Approved! ‚Çπ10 added"
     - If rejected: "‚ùå Referral Rejected. Reason: {reason}"

4. **Admin Marks as Paid**
   - POST to `/api/admin/referrals/:id/mark-paid`
   - System updates earnings (pending ‚Üí paid)
   - Sends notification: "üí∞ Payment Completed!"

### Payment Request Workflow

1. **User Requests Payment**
   - POST to `/api/referrals/request-payment`
   - Minimum ‚Çπ100 required

2. **Admin Processes Request**
   - View via `/api/admin/referrals/payment-requests`
   - Process via POST to `/api/admin/referrals/payment-requests/:id/process`
   - Mark as completed or failed

## API Examples

### Admin: Get Pending Referrals
```bash
GET /api/admin/referrals/pending?limit=50&offset=0
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
```

### Admin: Approve Referral
```bash
POST /api/admin/referrals/{transaction_id}/verify
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "approved"
}
```

### Admin: Reject Referral
```bash
POST /api/admin/referrals/{transaction_id}/verify
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "rejected",
  "rejectionReason": "Duplicate account detected"
}
```

### Admin: Mark as Paid
```bash
POST /api/admin/referrals/{transaction_id}/mark-paid
Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "paymentReference": "UPI123456789"
}
```

### User: Get Notifications
```bash
GET /api/notifications?limit=50
Authorization: Bearer {user_token}
```

## Frontend Integration

### Admin Panel Components Needed

1. **Referral Dashboard**
   - Display stats from `/api/admin/referrals/stats`
   - Show pending count, total earnings, etc.

2. **Pending Referrals Table**
   - Fetch from `/api/admin/referrals/pending`
   - Show referrer, referred user, date, status
   - Action buttons: Approve, Reject

3. **All Transactions Table**
   - Fetch from `/api/admin/referrals/transactions`
   - Filter by status, date range
   - Pagination support

4. **Payment Requests Table**
   - Fetch from `/api/admin/referrals/payment-requests`
   - Show user, amount, UPI ID, status
   - Action buttons: Complete, Fail

### User Notification Panel

The existing notification panel will automatically show referral notifications:
- Filter by type: `referral_signup`, `referral_approved`, `referral_rejected`, `referral_paid`
- Display with appropriate icons and colors
- Mark as read functionality already implemented

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Authentication**: All admin routes require `requireAuth` and `requireAdmin` middleware
2. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before processing
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using Supabase parameterized queries
4. **Rate Limiting**: Global rate limiting applied to all routes
5. **Audit Trail**: All admin actions should be logged (can be enhanced)

## Testing Checklist

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**: Send email in addition to in-app notifications
2. **Push Notifications**: Mobile push notifications for referral events
3. **Bulk Actions**: Approve/reject multiple referrals at once
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Charts, graphs, conversion rates
5. **Automated Verification**: AI-based fraud detection
6. **Referral Tiers**: Different reward amounts based on user activity
7. **Referral Campaigns**: Time-limited bonus campaigns
